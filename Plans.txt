Fugitive:
Rework on revive skills T2, make them weaker but last longer after death and add some reload speed/Fire rate or other to the effect (if else on the bulletstorm change for additional modifier)

Technician:
Make (non-turret) skills more viable/interesting. Don't condense mine or drill upgrades but add additional effects to them
