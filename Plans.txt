Add revive on death as capstone fugitive, basic 30% and ace with full armor (and aller CD?)

Gain something on melee hit (ammo or health, or dodge?)

Attacking an enemy makes them ignore you for a short time

Stamina based dodge chance? (optical illusions, put a nerfed version of the ace on basic)

In case of Agressive Reload basic buff, add a lose health on reload effect to it
